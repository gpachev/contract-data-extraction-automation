# App Test Organization Rule

For each app (for example: `apps/backend`), create a nested folder named `tests` inside the app directory. All tests for the given app must be placed in its `tests` subfolder (e.g., `apps/backend/tests`).

This ensures a clear separation of application code and tests, and makes test discovery and maintenance easier.
